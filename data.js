Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. <br>- Non-Critical Errors​: Non-critical errors are errors that are recovered by the participant and do not result in the participant’s ability to successfully complete the task. These errors result in the task being completed less efficiently. <br>- Time On Task​: The amount of time it takes the participant to complete the task. <br>- Likes, Dislikes and Recommendations (General considerations): Participants provide what they liked most about the site, what they liked least about the site, and recommendations for improving the site."

He suggested separating the two functions so that they are immediately obvious to the user; <br>- delete the envelope icon to indicate the contacts because it seems that through that icon the user sends an email to the staff. He suggests writing 'contacts' to enclose the possibility to contact us, to subscribe to the newsletter and to reach us on social channels; <br>- change the symbol of the shopping concept from shopping bag to cart because it is more used. <br><br>However, the user expressed interest in the project and he said he would gladly use the website. <br><br> After test changes: <br>The changes made to the wireframes after the test correspond to the suggestions provided by the user."
